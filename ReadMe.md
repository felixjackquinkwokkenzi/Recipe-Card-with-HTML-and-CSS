# Recipe Card UI

A simple recipe card component built with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project demonstrates how to design a clean and modern card layout with shadows, rounded corners, and styled details suitable for food-related content.

Although the design is not fully original â€” as I took inspiration from existing templates and then reimplemented it with my own code structure â€” this project represents an important step in my learning journey.  
I am aware that it still has many limitations, but I see it as a foundation to grow and improve my skills in frontend development.
